# VAC: Vector Access Protocol

## An Open Standard for Making Websites Understandable to AI

**Author**: Giuseppe Marci  
**License**: MIT  
**Version**: 0.1  
**Date**: July 24, 2025

---

## Overview

Today's web was built for humans and traditional search engines. It relies on HTML, keywords, and structured data to provide discoverability. But this model does not serve AI systems well. Large language models work differently ‚Äî they understand through context, embeddings, and vectors.

To bridge this gap, we introduce **VAC**, short for **Vector Access Protocol**. VAC enables any website to expose its content in a format designed for machines, allowing LLMs and AI agents to retrieve and understand it semantically.

The core format is a simple file called `.well-known/vectors.json`, which provides pre-computed vector embeddings of website content.

This allows AI tools to interact with your website meaningfully, without the need to scrape, crawl blindly, or re-embed your content from scratch.

---

## Why This Matters

Language models and semantic search engines need high-quality, structured data to reason well. But most content on the internet is locked inside HTML, scattered across pages, and unoptimized for vector-based retrieval.

VAC solves this problem by letting websites serve their own high-quality vectors. It is lightweight, privacy-friendly, easy to integrate, and open by design.

This is the next evolution in how content is published online. Not just for people. Not just for bots. But for intelligent systems that can reason with meaning.

---

## The `.well-known/vectors.json` Format

To make your site machine-readable via VAC, you publish a single file at the following path:

```
https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/vectors.json
```

### Example:

```json
{
  "version": "0.1",
  "site": "https://yourdomain.com",
  "updatedAt": "2025-07-24T12:00:00Z",
  "chunks": [
    {
      "url": "https://yourdomain.com/about",
      "content": "We are building the future of semantic web",
      "vector": [0.42, -0.67, ...],
      "metadata": {
        "title": "About Us",
        "tags": ["company", "mission", "team"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Key fields:

- `url`: The page the vector came from
- `content`: The text chunk that was embedded
- `vector`: The embedding itself (a list of floats)
- `metadata`: Optional information such as title, tags, language, etc.

---

## How It Works

A VAC-compatible system ‚Äî such as a crawler, LLM, or AI tool ‚Äî can fetch your `vectors.json`, read the semantic chunks, and use the vectors to answer questions, find relevant content, or ground its responses.

You choose the embedding model (for example, OpenAI, Cohere, or a local model like `nomic-embed-text`). The system consuming the vectors does not need to recompute anything ‚Äî it just reads and uses them.

---

## The VAC API (Optional)

For dynamic content or larger datasets, VAC also supports an optional API approach.

### Example endpoints:

- `GET /vac/manifest`  
  Returns metadata about your site's VAC implementation

- `POST /vac/query`  
  Accepts a search query or vector and returns the most relevant chunks

### Sample query:

```json
{
  "query": "how to protect crypto wallets",
  "top_k": 3
}
```

### Sample response:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "url": "https://yourdomain.com/security-guide",
      "score": 0.94,
      "content": "Always use cold storage and never share your seed phrase.",
      "metadata": {
        "title": "Crypto Security Tips"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This makes it possible to turn your website into an AI-friendly vector database without deploying one.

---

## Benefits of VAC

- Your site becomes LLM-accessible instantly
- AI agents can query your content without scraping
- You retain full control over what's exposed
- Great for knowledge bases, docs, blogs, legal content, or even app UIs
- Lightweight, works on any hosting environment
- Future-proof and privacy-respecting

---

## Use Cases

- A documentation site wants ChatGPT to understand its API without a plugin
- A personal blog wants to be indexed by a vector-based search engine
- A Web3 project wants AI to understand its protocol, directly from its landing page
- A legal portal wants to surface the right answer to a user query, even from multiple buried subpages

VAC makes all of this possible, without needing to register with any third party.

---

## Best Practices

- Start by embedding your homepage and most important content
- Split long pages into chunks of 300 to 500 tokens
- Keep vectors consistent in format (use the same model and dimension across all chunks)
- Refresh your vectors.json whenever content changes
- Always test your output locally using an LLM like Ollama or a VAC-compatible reader

---

## Roadmap

- Finalize and publish the VAC spec
- Launch CLI tool and starter kits for frameworks like Next.js and Astro
- Support optional verification via signed metadata headers
- Integrate VAC reading capabilities into open-source LLM agents
- Propose VAC as a semantic web standard to W3C and ecosystem partners

---

## Why Not Just Use RAG or Crawl?

You could, but:

- It wastes compute and bandwidth
- You lose semantic fidelity due to outdated snapshots
- It forces AI to interpret raw HTML instead of curated knowledge chunks
- It breaks when content changes
- It scales poorly across millions of sites

VAC offers a direct channel from the source to the AI.

---

## Final Thoughts

VAC gives websites a voice in the semantic internet. Not just as text on pages, but as structured meaning that AI can understand and act on.

With one file, you can make your site accessible to a new generation of tools ‚Äî from LLMs to intelligent crawlers, semantic search engines, and autonomous agents.

The future web is not just readable. It's understandable. VAC is how we get there.

2. **Automatic page discovery** - Finds pages via sitemap.xml or crawling
3. **Choose embedding scope**:
   - üîπ Embed ALL pages
   - üîπ Choose how many pages
   - üîπ Only embed homepage
4. **Processing** - Chunks and embeds content
5. **Output** - Creates `exports/websitename/.well-known/vectors.json`

### Command-Line Options (Coming Soon)

```bash
# Generate vectors for a specific URL
vac-cli generate https://example.com

# Use a different embedding model
vac-cli generate https://example.com --model text-embedding-ada-002

# Limit the number of pages
vac-cli generate https://example.com --max-pages 10

# Specify output directory
vac-cli generate https://example.com --output ./custom-dir

  "model": "nomic-embed-text",
  "updatedAt": "2025-07-23T18:00:00Z",
  "chunked": true,
  "files": [
    {
      "url": "https://example.com",
      "file": "/vectors/home.json",
      "chunks": 5
    },
    {
      "url": "https://example.com/about",
      "file": "/vectors/about.json",
      "chunks": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

## üåü Features
